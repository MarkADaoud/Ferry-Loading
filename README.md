# Ferry-Loading
The purpose of the "Ferry Loading" program is to demonstrate the application of a queue data structure implemented with a linked list. Specifically, the program illustrates how queues can be utilized to efficiently solve logistical problems, such as facilitating the transportation of vehicles across a river using a ferry.
Key Features:
Queue Implementation: Utilizes a custom queue implementation based on a linked list to manage the order of vehicles waiting to board the ferry.
Input Handling: Reads input data specifying the ferry's capacity (l), the maximum number of vehicles it can carry (m), and the number of vehicles waiting on each bank.
Simulation: Simulates the process of loading vehicles onto the ferry, ensuring that the weight and quantity constraints are not exceeded.
Crossing Calculation: Determines the minimum number of crossings required to transport all vehicles across the river, optimizing the ferry's capacity usage
